## 巴勒斯坦的国际认可   
As of September 2025, the State of Palestine is recognized as a sovereign state by 151 of the 193 member states of the United Nations, or just over 78% of all UN members. It has been a non-member observer state of the United Nations General Assembly since November 2012. This limited status is largely due to the fact that the United States, a permanent member of the UN Security Council with veto power, has consistently used its veto or threatened to do so to block Palestine's full UN membership.   

截至2025年9月，联合国193个成员国中有151个承认巴勒斯坦国为主权国家，占联合国所有成员国的78%多一点。自2012年11月以来，它一直是联合国大会非会员观察员国。这种有限的地位很大程度上是由于拥有否决权的联合国安理会常任理事国美国一直使用否决权或威胁使用否决权来阻止巴勒斯坦成为联合国正式会员国。
