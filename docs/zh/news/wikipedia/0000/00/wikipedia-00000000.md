## 美国_选举人_学院   
In the United States, the Electoral College is the group of presidential electors that is formed every four years during the presidential election for the sole purpose of voting for the president and vice president. The process is described in Article Two of the Constitution. The number of electoral votes exercised by each state is equal to that state's congressional delegation which is the number of Senators plus the number of Representatives for that state. Each state appoints electors using legal procedures determined by its legislature. Federal office holders, including senators and representatives, cannot be electors. Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment granted the federal District of Columbia three electors. A simple majority of electoral votes is required to elect the president and vice president. If no candidate achieves a majority, a contingent election is held by the House of Representatives, to elect the president, and by the Senate, to elect the vice president.   

在美国，选举团是每四年在总统选举期间组建的总统选举人团体，其唯一目的是投票选出总统和副总统。宪法第二条对这一过程进行了描述。每个州行使的选举人票数量等于该州国会代表团，即参议员人数加上该州众议员人数。每个州都按照其立法机构确定的法律程序任命选举人。联邦公职人员，包括参议员和众议员，不能成为选举人。此外，第十三修正案赋予联邦哥伦比亚特区三名选举人。选举总统和副总统需要简单多数选举人票。如果没有候选人获得多数席位，众议院将举行临时选举，选举总统，参议院将举行临时选举，选举副总统。

Months later, the Observance of 5th November Act mandated an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure.

## 红州和蓝州   
Starting with the 2000 United States presidential election, the terms "red state" and "blue state" have referred to US states whose voters vote predominantly for one party—the Republican Party in red states and the Democratic Party in blue states—in presidential and other statewide elections. By contrast, states where the vote fluctuates between the Democratic and Republican candidates are known as "swing states" or "purple states". Examining patterns within states reveals that the reversal of the two parties' geographic bases has happened at the state level, but it is more complicated locally, with urban-rural divides associated with many of the largest changes.   

从2000年美国总统选举开始，“红州”和“蓝州”一词指的是美国选民在总统选举和其他全州选举中主要投票给一个政党的州--红州的共和党和蓝州的民主党。相比之下，选票在民主党和共和党候选人之间波动的州被称为“摇摆州”或“紫色州”。检查各州内部的模式发现，两党地理基础的逆转发生在州一级，但局部情况更为复杂，城乡差距与许多最大的变化有关。
