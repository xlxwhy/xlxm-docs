## 6-7_（模因）   
The 6-7 meme ( ) is an internet meme and slang term that emerged in early 2025 on TikTok and Instagram Reels. It originated from the repeated lyric "6-7" in the song "Doot Doot " by Skrilla, which was used on social media in video edits of professional basketball players such as LaMelo Ball who is 6 feet 7 inches tall. The term "6-7" spread as slang among Generation Alpha and Generation Z. As the meme's reach expanded in August of 2025, one child became known as the "6-7 Kid" after a viral video showed him saying the term while moving his hands up and down at an Amateur Athletic Union basketball game. It is often compared to 41, a meme of similar origin, where rapper Blizzi Boi in his song "41 Song " repeats the number "41" throughout.

## 飓风_梅丽莎   
Hurricane Melissa is an active Atlantic hurricane between Jamaica and Cuba. The thirteenth named storm, fifth hurricane, fourth major hurricane, and third Category 5 hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Melissa formed from a tropical wave that was first monitored for development on October 16, 2025. The wave originated from West Africa, traveled from the central Atlantic to the Windward Islands, and then moved quickly westward into the Caribbean Sea, where it slowed down and developed into Tropical Storm Melissa on October 21. Weak steering currents and moderate wind shear kept Melissa meandering and disorganized for the next few days as it slowly moved northwest. Over time, Melissa became better organized, and from October 25 into 27, rapidly intensified into a Category 5 hurricane before making landfall near New Hope, Jamaica, on October 28.   

飓风梅丽莎是牙买加和古巴之间的一场活跃大西洋飓风。梅丽莎是2025年大西洋飓风季节的第十三场命名风暴、第五场飓风、第四场大型飓风和第三场5级飓风，由2025年10月16日首次监测发展的热带波形成。海浪起源于西非，从大西洋中部传播到向风群岛，然后迅速向西移动进入加勒比海，在那里速度减慢，并于10月21日发展成热带风暴梅丽莎。微弱的转向流和适度的风剪切使梅丽莎在接下来的几天里蜿蜒而混乱，缓慢地向西北移动。随着时间的推移，梅丽莎的组织变得更好，从10月25日到27日，她迅速增强为5级飓风，然后于10月28日在牙买加新霍普附近登陆。
