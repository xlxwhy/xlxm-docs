## 亚洲杯   
The Men's Asia Cup is the biennial cricket tournament organised by the Asian Cricket Council. The competition is contested by Asian members' senior men's national cricket teams, determining the continental champion of Asia. It was established in 1983 when the Asian Cricket Council was founded as a measure to promote goodwill between Asian countries, making it the only continental championship in cricket in which the winning team becomes the champion of Asia. India boycotted the 1986 tournament due to strained cricketing relations with Sri Lanka. Pakistan boycotted the 1990–91 tournament due to strained political relations with India and the 1993 tournament was cancelled for the same reason. The ACC announced that the tournament would be held biennially from 2009 onwards. The ICC has ruled that all games played in the Asia Cup have official ODI status.

## 6-7_（模因）   
The 6-7 meme ( ) is an internet meme and slang term that emerged in early 2025 on TikTok and Instagram Reels. It originated from the repeated lyric "6-7" in the song "Doot Doot " by Skrilla, which was used on social media in video edits of professional basketball players such as LaMelo Ball who is 6 feet 7 inches tall. The term "6-7" spread as slang among Generation Alpha and Generation Z. As the meme's reach expanded in August of 2025, one child became known as the "6-7 Kid" after a viral video showed him saying the term while moving his hands up and down at an Amateur Athletic Union basketball game. It is often compared to 41, a meme of similar origin, where rapper Blizzi Boi in his song "41 Song " repeats the number "41" throughout.   

6-7模因（）是一个互联网模因和俚语，于2025年初出现在TikTok和Instagram Reels上。它起源于Skrilla歌曲《Doot Doot》中重复的歌词“6-7”，该歌曲在社交媒体上被用于对身高6英尺7英寸的LaMelo Ball等职业篮球运动员进行视频编辑。“6-7”一词在Alpha世代和Z世代之间作为俚语传播。2025年8月，随着这个模因的影响范围扩大，一段广为流传的视频显示，一名孩子在业余田径联盟篮球比赛中上下移动双手时说出了这个词，因此被称为“6-7小子”。它经常被与41进行比较，41是一个起源相似的模因，说唱歌手Blizzi Boi在他的歌曲《41 Song》中自始至终重复了数字“41”。
