## 2024- 25_欧足联_欧洲_联赛   
The 2024–25 UEFA Europa League will be the 54th season of Europe's secondary club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 16th season since it was renamed from the UEFA Cup to the UEFA Europa League. This will be the first season played under a new format, which replaces the 32-team group stage with a 36-team league phase. This will increase the total number of matches played in the competition proper from 141 to 189. The new format also does not allow teams to transfer from the Champions League knockout stage to the Europa League knockout stage, and thus Europa League winners cannot defend their title as would all future Europa League winners as the winner of the Europa League automatically qualifies for the Champions League.   

2024-25年欧足联欧罗巴联赛将是欧足联举办的欧洲二级俱乐部足球锦标赛的第54个赛季，也是从欧足联杯更名为欧足联欧罗巴联赛以来的第16个赛季。这将是第一个以新形式进行的赛季，新形式将32支球队的小组赛阶段改为36支球队的联赛阶段。这将使比赛本身的比赛总数从141场增加到189场。新的形式也不允许球队从欧冠淘汰赛阶段转移到欧罗巴联赛淘汰赛阶段，因此欧罗巴联赛冠军无法像所有未来的欧罗巴联赛冠军一样卫冕，因为欧罗巴联赛冠军自动获得欧冠资格。
