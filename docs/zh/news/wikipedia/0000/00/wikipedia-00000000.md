## 2020年_联合_州_选举   
The 2020 United States elections were held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020. The Democratic Party's nominee, former vice president Joe Biden, defeated incumbent Republican president Donald Trump in the presidential election. Despite losing seats in the House of Representatives, Democrats retained control of the House and gained control of the Senate. As a result, the Democrats obtained a government trifecta, the first time since the elections in 2008 that the party gained unified control of Congress and the presidency. With Trump losing his bid for re-election, he became the first president to have seen his party lose the presidency and control of both the House and the Senate since Herbert Hoover in 1932. This was the first time since 1980 that either chamber of Congress flipped partisan control in a presidential year, and the first time Democrats did so since 1948.   

2020年美国大选于2020年11月3日星期二举行。民主党提名人、前副总统乔·拜登在总统选举中击败了现任共和党总统唐纳德·特朗普。尽管失去了众议院席位，民主党仍保留了众议院的控制权并获得了参议院的控制权。结果，民主党获得了政府三冠王，这是自2008年选举以来该党首次统一控制国会和总统职位。随着特朗普竞选连任失败，他成为自1932年赫伯特·胡佛以来第一位失去总统职位和众议院和参议院控制权的总统。这是自1980年以来，国会两院首次在总统年推翻党派控制权，也是民主党自1948年以来首次这样做。

## 美国_选举人_学院   
In the United States, the Electoral College is the group of presidential electors that is formed every four years during the presidential election for the sole purpose of voting for the president and vice president. The process is described in Article Two of the Constitution. The number of electoral votes exercised by each state is equal to that state's congressional delegation which is the number of Senators plus the number of Representatives for that state. Each state appoints electors using legal procedures determined by its legislature. Federal office holders, including senators and representatives, cannot be electors. Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment granted the federal District of Columbia three electors. A simple majority of electoral votes is required to elect the president and vice president. If no candidate achieves a majority, a contingent election is held by the House of Representatives, to elect the president, and by the Senate, to elect the vice president.   

在美国，选举团是每四年在总统选举期间组建的总统选举人团体，其唯一目的是投票选出总统和副总统。宪法第二条对这一过程进行了描述。每个州行使的选举人票数量等于该州国会代表团，即参议员人数加上该州众议员人数。每个州都按照其立法机构确定的法律程序任命选举人。联邦公职人员，包括参议员和众议员，不能成为选举人。此外，第十三修正案赋予联邦哥伦比亚特区三名选举人。选举总统和副总统需要简单多数选举人票。如果没有候选人获得多数席位，众议院将举行临时选举，选举总统，参议院将举行临时选举，选举副总统。

## 项目_2025   
The 2025 Presidential Transition Project, also known as Project 2025, is an initiative organized by the Heritage Foundation with the aim of promoting a collection of conservative and right-wing policy proposals to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power should Donald Trump win the 2024 presidential election. The Project asserts that the entire executive branch is under the direct control of the president under Article II of the U.S. Constitution and the unitary executive theory. It proposes reclassifying tens of thousands of federal civil service workers as political appointees, in order to replace them with loyalists more willing to enable Trump's policies. In doing so, proponents argue that the change would dismantle what they view as a vast, unaccountable, and mostly liberal government bureaucracy. The Project seeks to infuse the government and society with Christian values. Critics have characterized Project 2025 as an authoritarian, Christian nationalist plan to steer the U.S. toward autocracy. Many legal experts have said it would undermine the rule of law, the separation of powers, the separation of church and state, and civil liberties.   

2025年总统过渡项目，也被称为2025年项目，是由传统基金会组织的一个倡议，目的是促进一系列保守派和右翼政策建议的收集，以重塑美国联邦政府，并巩固行政权力，如果唐纳德·特朗普赢得2024年总统选举的话。该项目声称，根据美国宪法第二条和单一行政理论，整个行政部门都在总统的直接控制之下。它提议将数万名联邦公务员重新归类为政治任命人员，以取代他们，让更愿意支持特朗普政策的忠诚者取而代之。在这样做的过程中，支持者辩称，这一变化将瓦解他们认为庞大、不负责任、大多是自由派的政府官僚机构。该项目旨在向政府和社会灌输基督教价值观。批评人士将2025计划描述为一个威权的基督教民族主义计划，旨在引导美国走向独裁。许多法律专家表示，这将破坏法治、权力分离、政教分离和公民自由。

## 美国总统名单   
The president of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States, indirectly elected to a four-year term via the Electoral College. The officeholder leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. Since the office was established in 1789, 45 men have served in 46 presidencies. The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College. Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of individuals who have served as president.   

美国总统是美国的国家元首和政府首脑，通过选举团间接选举产生，任期四年。该官员领导联邦政府的行政部门，也是美国武装部队的总司令。自1789年该办公室成立以来，已有45名男性担任过46位总统。第一任总统乔治·华盛顿赢得了选举团的一致投票。格罗弗·克利夫兰（Grover Cleveland）连续任职两届，因此被算作美国第22任和第24任总统，导致总统人数与担任总统人数之间的差异。

## 红州和蓝州   
Starting with the 2000 United States presidential election, the terms "red state" and "blue state" have referred to US states whose voters vote predominantly for one party—the Republican Party in red states and the Democratic Party in blue states—in presidential and other statewide elections. By contrast, states where the vote fluctuates between the Democratic and Republican candidates are known as "swing states" or "purple states". Examining patterns within states reveals that the reversal of the two parties' geographic bases has happened at the state level, but it is more complicated locally, with urban-rural divides associated with many of the largest changes.   

从2000年美国总统选举开始，“红州”和“蓝州”一词指的是美国选民在总统选举和其他全州选举中主要投票给一个政党的州--红州的共和党和蓝州的民主党。相比之下，选票在民主党和共和党候选人之间波动的州被称为“摇摆州”或“紫色州”。检查各州内部的模式发现，两党地理基础的逆转发生在州一级，但局部情况更为复杂，城乡差距与许多最大的变化有关。
