## 6-7_（模因）   
The 6-7 meme ( ) is an internet meme and slang term that emerged in early 2025 on TikTok and Instagram Reels. It originated from the repeated lyric "6-7" in the song "Doot Doot " by Skrilla, which was used on social media in video edits of professional basketball players such as LaMelo Ball who is 6 feet 7 inches tall. The term "6-7" spread as slang among Generation Alpha and Generation Z. As the meme's reach expanded in August of 2025, one child became known as the "6-7 Kid" after a viral video showed him saying the term while moving his hands up and down at an Amateur Athletic Union basketball game. It is often compared to 41, a meme of similar origin, where rapper Blizzi Boi in his song "41 Song " repeats the number "41" throughout.
