## 9月11日_袭击   
The September 11 attacks, commonly known as 9/11, were four coordinated Islamist terrorist suicide attacks carried out by al-Qaeda against the United States in 2001. On that morning, 19 terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners scheduled to travel from the East Coast to California. The hijackers crashed the first two planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and aimed the next two flights toward targets in or near Washington, D.C., in an attack on the nation's capital. The third team succeeded in striking the Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense in Arlington County, Virginia, while the fourth plane crashed in rural Pennsylvania during a passenger revolt. The September 11 attacks killed 2,977 people, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in history. In response to the attacks, the United States waged the multi-decade global war on terror to eliminate hostile groups deemed terrorist organizations, as well as the foreign governments purported to support them, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and several other countries.

## 2025_尼泊尔_世代_Z_抗议   
In September 2025, large-scale demonstrations, commonly referred to as the Gen Z protests took place across Nepal, predominantly organized by Gen Z students and young citizens. The protests began following a nationwide ban on many popular social media platforms, but had their origin in the public's frustration with the perceived corruption of and display of wealth by government officials and their families, as well as allegations of mismanagement of public funds. The movement quickly expanded to encompass broader issues of governance, transparency, and political accountability. The protests quickly escalated with violence against public officials and vandalism of government and political buildings taking place throughout the country.   

2025年9月，尼泊尔各地发生了大规模示威活动，通常称为Z世代抗议活动，主要由Z世代学生和年轻公民组织。抗议活动是在全国范围内禁止许多流行社交媒体平台之后开始的，但其根源是公众对政府官员及其家人腐败和炫耀财富的不满，以及对公共资金管理不善的指控。该运动迅速扩大到治理、透明度和政治问责等更广泛的问题。抗议活动迅速升级，全国各地都发生了针对公职人员的暴力事件以及对政府和政治建筑的破坏事件。
