## 世界系列赛冠军名单   
The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) and concludes the MLB postseason. First played in 1903, the World Series championship is a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and American League (AL). Often referred to as the "Fall Classic", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike. The best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920, 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff. Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. Players, coaches and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory; however, they have received other items such as pocket watches and medallions in the past. The winning team is traditionally invited to the White House to meet the President of the United States.   

世界系列赛是美国职业棒球大联盟(MLB)的年度冠军系列赛，结束了MLB的季后赛。世界系列赛于1903年首次举行，是七局四胜制的季后赛，是棒球国家联盟(NL)和美国联盟(AL)冠军之间的比赛。自1903年以来，现代世界系列赛每年都会举行，但有两个例外：1904年，国联冠军纽约巨人队拒绝与美联冠军波士顿美国队交手；1994年，由于球员罢工，系列赛被取消。除了1903,1919,1920,1921年的世界系列赛，七局四胜制一直是所有世界系列赛的形式，当时通过九局四胜的季后赛决定获胜者。虽然大多数比赛都是在10月份进行的，但也有一小部分系列赛在9月和11月进行了比赛。获得系列赛冠军的球队被授予专员奖杯。球员、教练和其他与球队有关联的人通常会得到世界大赛戒指，以纪念他们的胜利；然而，他们过去也会收到其他物品，如怀表和奖章。获胜的球队传统上会被邀请到白宫会见美国总统。

## 夏令时   
Daylight saving time (DST), also referred to as daylight saving(s), daylight savings time, daylight time (United States and Canada), or summer time (United Kingdom, European Union, and others), is the practice of advancing clocks to make better use of the longer daylight available during summer so that darkness falls at a later clock time. The typical implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in spring or late winter, and to set clocks back by one hour to standard time in the autumn (or fall in North American English, hence the mnemonic: "spring forward and fall back").   

夏令时（DST），也称为夏令时、夏令时（美国和加拿大）或夏令时（英国、欧盟等），是提前时钟以更好地利用夏季可用的较长日光的做法，以便黑暗在较晚的时钟时间降临。DST的典型实现是在春季或冬末将时钟拨快一小时，并在秋季（北美英语中为秋季，因此有助记词：“春季向前并回落”）将时钟拨快一小时至标准时间。
