## 民意撕裂 尹锡悦去留引发韩国朝野对抗加剧   
This week, political disputes in South Korea have intensified and political chaos continues to intensify. South Korea's "Joint Investigation Headquarters" said on January 4 that the Senior Public Officials Crime Investigation Office (Public Mediation) sent an official document to Choi Sang-moo, who was acting as the president, that afternoon, requesting him to coordinate and command the Presidential Security Office to cooperate with the execution of the arrest warrant of suspended President Yoon Seok Yoon. Public opinion in South Korea is showing a polarized trend around Yoon's future and stay: on the one hand, recent polls in South Korea show that more than 70% of respondents support impeaching Yoon Seok; on the other hand, conservative groups who are Yoon Seok Yoon's "iron fans" are gradually increasing their support for him.

这一周，韩国政治纷争愈演愈烈，政坛混乱继续加剧。韩国“共同调查本部”1月4日说，高级公职人员犯罪调查处（公调处）当天下午向代行总统职权的崔相穆发送公文，请求其协调指挥总统警卫处配合执行被停职总统尹锡悦的逮捕令。围绕尹锡悦的去留，韩国民意正呈现两极化趋势：一方面，韩国近期民调显示，有超过七成的受访者支持弹劾尹锡悦；另一方面，作为尹锡悦“铁粉”的保守团体对他的支持力度在逐渐增大。

## 文化中国行·诗意节令丨小寒：银装映冬色 梅香暖乾坤   
At this time of year, the northern country is vast and thousands of miles of ice are frozen; many places in the south are chilly to the bone. In the "Collected Explanation of the Seventy-two Charities of the Moon" compiled by Wu Cheng, a literati of the Yuan Dynasty, it is said: "On December Day, the cold at the beginning of the month is still small, so it is said. Half the moon is bigger." It means that the weather is cold during the small cold season, but it has not reached the coldest. When the big cold season, the cold will reach its extreme.

此时节，北国四野苍茫，千里冰封；南方多地寒意刺骨。元代文人吴澄编著的《月令七十二候集解》中说：“十二月节，月初寒尚小，故云。月半则大矣。”意为小寒时节天气寒冷，但未至最寒，到大寒时节，寒冷才会达到极致。

## 滑雪“追尾”致人受伤 谁该为意外“买单”   
In recent years, skiing has become one of the most popular winter outdoor sports. However, due to the high risk of skiing, accidents caused by falling or colliding with others often occur. Recently, the People's Court of Xicheng District of Beijing City heard a civil dispute caused by the "rear-end collision" of a ski resort. The court found that the skiers in front had priority in using the ski slopes. After summarizing the circumstances, it was ruled that the skiers in the back should bear 60% of the responsibility, and the skiers in the front should each bear 20% of the responsibility.

## 小寒来了！养生防病注意啥？最全科普   
At 10:33 Beijing time today (5th), we will usher in the 23rd solar term of the 24 solar terms-Xiaohan. The small cold solar term also marks the coming of the coldest period of the year. Although the small cold solar term has the word "small", in this solar term, the temperature is the lowest in the year. This year, the small cold season has entered the "29th", and the "39th" has fallen entirely within the small cold solar terms. Therefore, there is a saying that "the small cold wins the big cold". At this time, wind, rain, snow, etc. are common in the north and south.
