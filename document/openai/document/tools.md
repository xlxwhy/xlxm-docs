Tools Beta
Give Assistants access to OpenAI-hosted tools like Code Interpreter and Knowledge Retrieval, or build your own tools using Function calling. Usage of OpenAI-hosted tools comes at an additional fee — visit our help center article to learn more about how these tools are priced.

The Assistants API is in beta and we are actively working on adding more functionality. Share your feedback in our Developer Forum!
Code Interpreter
Code Interpreter allows the Assistants API to write and run Python code in a sandboxed execution environment. This tool can process files with diverse data and formatting, and generate files with data and images of graphs. Code Interpreter allows your Assistant to run code iteratively to solve challenging code and math problems. When your Assistant writes code that fails to run, it can iterate on this code by attempting to run different code until the code execution succeeds.

Code Interpreter is charged at $0.03 per session. If your Assistant calls Code Interpreter simultaneously in two different threads (e.g., one thread per end-user), two Code Interpreter sessions are created. Each session is active by default for one hour, which means that you only pay for one session per if users interact with Code Interpreter in the same thread for up to one hour.

Enabling Code Interpreter
Pass the code_interpreterin the tools parameter of the Assistant object to enable Code Interpreter:

python

python
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  instructions="You are a personal math tutor. When asked a math question, write and run code to answer the question.",
  model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
  tools=[{"type": "code_interpreter"}]
)
The model then decides when to invoke Code Interpreter in a Run based on the nature of the user request. This behavior can be promoted by prompting in the Assistant's instructions (e.g., “write code to solve this problem”).

Passing files to Code Interpreter
Code Interpreter can parse data from files. This is useful when you want to provide a large volume of data to the Assistant or allow your users to upload their own files for analysis. Note that files uploaded for Code Interpreter are not indexed for retrieval. See the Knowledge Retrieval section below for more details on indexing files for retrieval.

Files that are passed at the Assistant level are accessible by all Runs with this Assistant:

python

python
# Upload a file with an "assistants" purpose
file = client.files.create(
  file=open("speech.py", "rb"),
  purpose='assistants'
)

# Create an assistant using the file ID
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  instructions="You are a personal math tutor. When asked a math question, write and run code to answer the question.",
  model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
  tools=[{"type": "code_interpreter"}],
  file_ids=[file.id]
)
You do not pay for files attached to an Assistant or Message when used with Code Interpreter. You are only charged for files that are indexed for retrieval which happens automatically if the Retrieval tool is enabled.
Files can also be passed at the Thread level. These files are only accessible in the specific Thread. Upload the File using the File upload endpoint and then pass the File ID as part of the Message creation request:

python

python
thread = client.beta.threads.create(
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I need to solve the equation `3x + 11 = 14`. Can you help me?",
      "file_ids": [file.id]
    }
  ]
)
Files have a maximum size of 512 MB. Code Interpreter supports a variety of file formats including .csv, .pdf, .json and many more. More details on the file extensions (and their corresponding MIME-types) supported can be found in the Supported files section below.

Reading images and files generated by Code Interpreter
Code Interpreter in the API also outputs files, such as generating image diagrams, CSVs, and PDFs. There are two types of files that are generated:

Images
Data files (e.g. a csv file with data generated by the Assistant)
When Code Interpreter generates an image, you can look up and download this file in the file_id field of the Assistant Message response:

{
    "id": "msg_abc123",
    "object": "thread.message",
    "created_at": 1698964262,
    "thread_id": "thread_abc123",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [
    {
      "type": "image_file",
      "image_file": {
        "file_id": "file-abc123"
      }
    }
  ]
  # ...
}
The file content can then be downloaded by passing the file ID to the Files API:

python

python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

image_data = client.files.content("file-abc123")
image_data_bytes = image_data.read()

with open("./my-image.png", "wb") as file:
    file.write(image_data_bytes)
When Code Interpreter references a file path (e.g., ”Download this csv file”), file paths are listed as annotations. You can convert these annotations into links to download the file:

{
  "id": "msg_abc123",
  "object": "thread.message",
  "created_at": 1699073585,
  "thread_id": "thread_abc123",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": {
        "value": "The rows of the CSV file have been shuffled and saved to a new CSV file. You can download the shuffled CSV file from the following link:\n\n[Download Shuffled CSV File](sandbox:/mnt/data/shuffled_file.csv)",
        "annotations": [
          {
            "type": "file_path",
            "text": "sandbox:/mnt/data/shuffled_file.csv",
            "start_index": 167,
            "end_index": 202,
            "file_path": {
              "file_id": "file-abc123"
            }
          }
          ...
Input and output logs of Code Interpreter
By listing the steps of a Run that called Code Interpreter, you can inspect the code input and outputs logs of Code Interpreter:

python

python
run_steps = client.beta.threads.runs.steps.list(
  thread_id=thread.id,
  run_id=run.id
)
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "step_abc123",
      "object": "thread.run.step",
      "type": "tool_calls",
      "run_id": "run_abc123",
      "thread_id": "thread_abc123",
      "status": "completed",
      "step_details": {
        "type": "tool_calls",
        "tool_calls": [
          {
            "type": "code",
            "code": {
              "input": "# Calculating 2 + 2\nresult = 2 + 2\nresult",
              "outputs": [
                {
                  "type": "logs",
                  "logs": "4"
                }
                        ...
 }
Knowledge Retrieval
Retrieval augments the Assistant with knowledge from outside its model, such as proprietary product information or documents provided by your users. Once a file is uploaded and passed to the Assistant, OpenAI will automatically chunk your documents, index and store the embeddings, and implement vector search to retrieve relevant content to answer user queries.

Enabling Retrieval
Pass the retrieval in the tools parameter of the Assistant to enable Retrieval:

python

python
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  instructions="You are a customer support chatbot. Use your knowledge base to best respond to customer queries.",
  model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
  tools=[{"type": "retrieval"}]
)
If you enable retrieval for a specific Assistant, all the files attached will be automatically indexed and you will be charged the $0.20/GB per assistant per day. You can enabled/disable retrieval by using the Modify Assistant endpoint.
How it works
The model then decides when to retrieve content based on the user Messages. The Assistants API automatically chooses between two retrieval techniques:

it either passes the file content in the prompt for short documents, or
performs a vector search for longer documents
Retrieval currently optimizes for quality by adding all relevant content to the context of model calls. We plan to introduce other retrieval strategies to enable developers to choose a different tradeoff between retrieval quality and model usage cost.

Uploading files for retrieval
Similar to Code Interpreter, files can be passed at the Assistant-level or individual Message-level.

python

python
# Upload a file with an "assistants" purpose
file = client.files.create(
  file=open("knowledge.pdf", "rb"),
  purpose='assistants'
)

# Add the file to the assistant
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  instructions="You are a customer support chatbot. Use your knowledge base to best respond to customer queries.",
  model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
  tools=[{"type": "retrieval"}],
  file_ids=[file.id]
)
When a file is attached at the Message-level, it is only accessible within the specific Thread the Message is attached to. After having uploaded a file, you can pass the ID of this File when creating the Message. Note that you are not charged based on the size of the files you upload via the Files API but rather based on which files you attach to a specific Assistant or Message that get indexed.

python

python
message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
  thread_id=thread.id,
  role="user",
  content="I can not find in the PDF manual how to turn off this device.",
  file_ids=[file.id]
)
The maximum file size is 512 MB and no more than 2,000,000 tokens (computed automatically when you attach a file). Retrieval supports a variety of file formats including .pdf, .md, .docx and many more. More details on the file extensions (and their corresponding MIME-types) supported can be found in the Supported files section below.

Retrieval pricing
Retrieval is priced at $0.20/GB per assistant per day. Attaching a single file ID to multiple assistants will incur the per assistant per day charge when the retrieval tool is enabled. For example, if you attach the same 1 GB file to two different Assistants with the retrieval tool enabled (e.g., customer-facing Assistant #1 and internal employee Assistant #2), you’ll be charged twice for this storage fee (2 * $0.20 per day). This fee does not vary with the number of end users and threads retrieving knowledge from a given assistant.

In addition, files attached to messages are charged on a per-assistant basis if the messages are part of a run where the retrieval tool is enabled. For example, running an assistant with retrieval enabled on a thread with 10 messages each with 1 unique file (10 total unique files) will incur a per-GB per-day charge on all 10 files (in addition to any files attached to the assistant itself).

Deleting files
To remove a file from the assistant, you can detach the file from the assistant:

python

python
file_deletion_status = client.beta.assistants.files.delete(
  assistant_id=assistant.id,
  file_id=file.id
)
Detaching the file from the assistant removes the file from the retrieval index and means you will no longer be charged for the storage of the indexed file.

File citations
When Code Interpreter outputs file paths in a Message, you can convert them to corresponding file downloads using the annotations field. See the Annotations section for an example of how to do this.

{
    "id": "msg_abc123",
    "object": "thread.message",
    "created_at": 1699073585,
    "thread_id": "thread_abc123",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": {
          "value": "The rows of the CSV file have been shuffled and saved to a new CSV file. You can download the shuffled CSV file from the following link:\n\n[Download Shuffled CSV File](sandbox:/mnt/data/shuffled_file.csv)",
          "annotations": [
            {
              "type": "file_path",
              "text": "sandbox:/mnt/data/shuffled_file.csv",
              "start_index": 167,
              "end_index": 202,
              "file_path": {
                "file_id": "file-abc123"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "file_ids": [
      "file-abc456"
    ],
        ...
  },
Function calling
Similar to the Chat Completions API, the Assistants API supports function calling. Function calling allows you to describe functions to the Assistants and have it intelligently return the functions that need to be called along with their arguments. The Assistants API will pause execution during a Run when it invokes functions, and you can supply the results of the function call back to continue the Run execution.

Defining functions
First, define your functions when creating an Assistant:

python

python
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  instructions="You are a weather bot. Use the provided functions to answer questions.",
  model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
  tools=[{
      "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "getCurrentWeather",
      "description": "Get the weather in location",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state e.g. San Francisco, CA"},
          "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["c", "f"]}
        },
        "required": ["location"]
      }
    }
  }, {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "getNickname",
      "description": "Get the nickname of a city",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state e.g. San Francisco, CA"},
        },
        "required": ["location"]
      }
    } 
  }]
)
Reading the functions called by the Assistant
When you initiate a Run with a user Message that triggers the function, the Run will enter a pending status. After it processes, the run will enter a requires_action state which you can verify by retrieving the Run. The model can provide multiple functions to call at once using parallel function calling:

{
  "id": "run_abc123",
  "object": "thread.run",
  "assistant_id": "asst_abc123",
  "thread_id": "thread_abc123",
  "status": "requires_action",
  "required_action": {
    "type": "submit_tool_outputs",
    "submit_tool_outputs": {
      "tool_calls": [
        {
          "id": "call_abc123",
          "type": "function",
          "function": {
            "name": "getCurrentWeather",
            "arguments": "{\"location\":\"San Francisco\"}"
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "call_abc456",
          "type": "function",
          "function": {
            "name": "getNickname",
            "arguments": "{\"location\":\"Los Angeles\"}"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
...
Submitting functions outputs
You can then complete the Run by submitting the tool output from the function(s) you call. Pass the tool_call_id referenced in the required_action object above to match output to each function call.

python

python
run = client.beta.threads.runs.submit_tool_outputs(
  thread_id=thread.id,
  run_id=run.id,
  tool_outputs=[
      {
        "tool_call_id": call_ids[0],
        "output": "22C",
      },
      {
        "tool_call_id": call_ids[1],
        "output": "LA",
      },
    ]
)
After submitting outputs, the run will enter the queued state before it continues it’s execution.
